# Yembrace
This was the project that I worked on in my undergraduate and was funded by Innohabit Technologies.

The object of this product was to provide a better in store shopping exprience to the customer and shop owner.

This leveraged the beacon technology to accuratly detect position of the shopper and provide him/her location based personalized notifications. 

The product was launched on mobile (Android) as well as on web platform. The mobile platform consisted on 2 Andorid Apps, one for the general public (shoppers) and the other for the clients of our product (shop owners). 

I was the developed the andorid moblie app from scratch using android studio as IDE and published multiple version of the App of the Google Play Store. The App was compatile for the android version 4.1 (Jelly Bean) and above.
Some of the screen shots of the App.

As a first time developer of an Android App I had to go through multiple revision of the app design 
We also exprimented with the offline version of the app.
